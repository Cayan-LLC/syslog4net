        EventLogTraceListener - Writes to the Windows Event Log.

        Events are logged with the event Id (maximum 65535), and with a severity based on
        the EventType (Critial and Error are logged as errors, Warning is logged as a 
        warning, all others as information).
        
        The message, or non-empty formatted message with arguments inserted is written as
        the event entry data. If TraceData() is used, then the data items are concatenated 
        with ", " and then written as the event entry data.
        
        If, however, a null or empty format message is used then the format arguments
        are used directly as the event entry data - this allows them to be used as 
        multiple replacement strings for an event log entry ID specified in a registered
        DLL. (See EventLog.WriteEvent() for details.)
        
        Usually you will want to filter events sent to the Windows Event Log to only
        include those above a certain level / event type.

        Note: You must include an installer (that is run by an administrator)
        to create the event log source (specified in initializeData), otherwise events 
        cannot be written to it by normal process accounts. This limits the values that
        can be used in initializeData to created event log sources.
        
        initalizeData - name of the event log source
        
        traceOutputOptions - ignored.
