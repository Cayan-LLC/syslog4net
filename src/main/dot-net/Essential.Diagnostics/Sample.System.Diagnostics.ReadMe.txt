Using and extending System.Diagnostics trace logging. 

This package contains example .config settings for common 
.NET Framework System.Diagnostics listeners, including 
console, rolling file, Windows event log and XML listeners.

Your app.config or web.config file will have been updated 
with sample configurations.

This configuration file is maintained as part of the 
Essential.Diagnostics project that provides guidance and 
examples on using System.Diagnostics, as well as additional 
listeners and extensions.

See the Essential.Diagnostics project site on CodePlex for 
additional examples and documentation, or install the 
Essential.Diagnostics.Config package for the additional 
listeners with configuration.
