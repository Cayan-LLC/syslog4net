! TextWriterTraceListener Class

Writes trace events to a simple file.

If you want to write trace events to a text file using only the .NET Framework, it is strongly recommended that you use [FileLogTraceListener] instead (which is in the Visual Basic namespace). 

Alternatively with Essential.Diagnostics you can used [RollingFileTraceListener], which allows a customised output format and alternative creation frequencies.
