!! [Listeners]

The following trace listeners are provided by the .NET Framework and the Essential.Diagnostics extensions.

| [BufferedEmailTraceListener][image:EX|http://www.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=essentialdiagnostics&DownloadId=150104] | Writes trace events to an Email message sent at the end of the host process. |
| [ColoredConsoleTraceListener][image:EX|http://www.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=essentialdiagnostics&DownloadId=150104] | Writes formatted trace events to the console in color based on the type. |
| [ConsoleTraceListener] | Writes trace events to the console |
| DefaultTraceListener |  |
| DelimitedListTraceListener | Writes trace events to a file as a delimited list. |
| [EmailTraceListener][image:EX|http://www.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=essentialdiagnostics&DownloadId=150104] | Writes trace events to Email messages sent asynchronously. |
| [EventLogTraceListener] | Writes trace events to the Windows Event Log |
| EventProviderTraceListener |  |
| EventSchemaTraceListener |  |
| [FileLogTraceListener] | Writes trace events to a file with advanced options for file rotation and output format. |
| FlatFileTraceListener^^1^^ | |
| FormattedEventLogTraceListener^^1^^ | |
| [InMemoryTraceListener][image:EX|http://www.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=essentialdiagnostics&DownloadId=150104] | Writes traces to an in-memory array. |
| [RollingFileTraceListener][image:EX|http://www.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=essentialdiagnostics&DownloadId=150104] | Trace listener that writes formatted messages to a text file, rolling to a new file based on a filename template (usually including the date). |
| [RollingXmlTraceListener][image:EX|http://www.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=essentialdiagnostics&DownloadId=150104] | Trace listener that writes E2ETraceEvent XML fragments to a text file, rolling to a new file based on a filename template (usually including the date). |
| [SqlDatabaseTraceListener][image:EX|http://www.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=essentialdiagnostics&DownloadId=150104] | Writes trace information to a SQL database. |
| [TextWriterTraceListener] | Writes trace events to a simple file. Recommended you at least use [FileLogTraceListener] instead. |
| WebPageTraceListener | Forwards trace events to the ASP.NET trace output. |
| WMITraceListener^^1^^ | |
| [XmlWriterTraceListener] | Writes events in XML format, suitable for import into the Service Trace Viewer utility. |

Note: ^^1^^ These trace listeners from the Enterprise Library Logging Application Block can also be used directly with System.Diagnostics (for details see [url:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff664735%28v=PandP.50%29.aspx]).

!! [Filters]

| EventTypeFilter | Filters based on the level of the TraceEventType, e.g. Warning, Error, etc. |
| [ExpressionFilter][image:EX|http://www.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=essentialdiagnostics&DownloadId=150104] | Filter events based on an expression. |
| [PropertyFilter][image:EX|http://www.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=essentialdiagnostics&DownloadId=150104] | Filter events based on the value of a single property. |
| SourceFilter | Filters based on the TraceSource that generated the message. |

!! [Extensions]

| [ActivityScope][image:EX|http://www.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=essentialdiagnostics&DownloadId=150104] | Sets the correlation ActivityId for the life of the scope object, performs a transfer, and logs activity messages. |
| [LogicalOperationScope][image:EX|http://www.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=essentialdiagnostics&DownloadId=150104] | Sets the correlation LogicalOperation stack for the life of the scope object. |
| [TraceFormatter][image:EX|http://www.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=essentialdiagnostics&DownloadId=150104] | Inserts trace information into a provided template string. Used to provide the advanced formatting for several listeners. |
| [TraceConfigurationMonitor][image:EX|http://www.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=essentialdiagnostics&DownloadId=150104] | Monitors the config file for changes are refreshes trace listeners when required. |

!! [Diagnostics.Abstractions|Abstractions]

| [AssemblyTraceSource<T>][image:EX|ex.png] | Enable applications to trace the execution of code and associate trace messages with a source named after the assembly the generic type is from. |
| [ITraceSource][image:EX|ex.png] | Defines a set of methods and properties that enable applications to trace the execution of code and associate trace messages with their source.  |
| [ITraceSource<T>][image:EX|ex.png] | Defines a set of methods and properties that enable applications to trace the execution of code and associate trace messages with a source related to a specific class. |
| [TraceSourceWrapper][image:EX|ex.png] | Provides a wrapper around TraceSource that implements the ITraceSource interface, enable applications to trace the execution of code and associate trace messages with their source in a decoupled manner. |

!! Base Classes

| TraceListener | Base trace listener class provided by the .NET framework. |
| [TraceListenerBase][image:EX|http://www.codeplex.com/download?ProjectName=essentialdiagnostics&DownloadId=150104] | Extended trace listener designed to be subclassed with as little as a single template method override. |
| TraceFilter | Base trace filter class provided by the .NET framework. |
